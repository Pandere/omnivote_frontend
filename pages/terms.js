<h2>Dos and Don'ts</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Do use your common sense. We want the area to be an engaging and enjoyable place. We want to help ensure you behave reasonably and sensibly. What is - or is not - acceptable is usually a matter of common sense.</li>
    <li>
        Do remember that this area is moderated in part only and that we do not pre-screen material before it is posted. Moderators will help moderate and manage real-time discussion and we will run regular checks of user submissions in
        addition, but sometimes submissions are made that are inappropriate. As in any community we need your assistance to control this issue.
    </li>
    <li>Do respect other users. Lots of us have strong beliefs about many things. That doesn't mean we can't agree to disagree. Please remember that others have a right to an opinion that may differ from yours.</li>
    <li>
        Do report any comments, posts, videos, photographs or anything else in this area (or elsewhere on the Website) which breach these rules or offend you or make you feel uncomfortable. Without your help in reporting objectionable
        content or other inappropriate submissions and behaviour, the area won't work as well. Please provide as much relevant information as you can. We will always treat reports seriously and, where appropriate, in confidence. We also
        provide links to outside agencies and authorities, but in most circumstances you should report the submission to us in the first instance.
    </li>
    <li>Do remember that we reserve the right to use, delete, edit, move and merge your submissions without telling you and that our (or our moderators') decisions are final.</li>
    <li>Do submit your comments in English. This helps us to check that the submission is appropriate.</li>
    <li>Do check these rules regularly as we may need to change them and please be aware that additional usage terms may also apply and these will be marked on the relevant part of the Website.</li>
    <li>
        Don't engage in personal abuse or express any kind of hatred towards any group because of their religious, racial, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender, age or disability. Discuss the points made intelligently in a
        submission, not directly towards the person putting it forward.
    </li>
    <li>Don't make any submissions which are obscene or may be considered to be offensive, or illegal or to promote illegal or inappropriate behaviour.</li>
    <li>Don't use the area in a manner that interferes with, or disrupts, anyone else's use or enjoyment of the site. Don't impersonate others or otherwise make fraudulent or deceptive postings.</li>
    <li>Don't make submissions which are off-topic, unless we state that such off-topic submissions are allowed in a particular area of the Website.</li>
    <li>Don't submit libellous or defamatory remarks. That means not submitting anything which you can't prove to be true and which might damage someone's reputation.</li>
    <li>Don't post comments about people's private lives or any matter which is the subject of on-going legal proceedings. If in doubt, don't post it!</li>
    <li>Don't endanger yourself or others.</li>
    <li>Do respect people's privacy.</li>
    <li>Do keep personal information private and don't post email addresses, phone numbers or other personal data in a comment of an entrant.</li>
    <li>Don't advertise or use this area for commercial purposes.</li>
    <li>Once again, these simple rules have been written with one aim in mind, for you to enjoy the area and keep it safe and fun.</li>
